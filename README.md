# My Blockchain Projects

I have created multiple blockchain related projects for hackathons and as side projects. Some of them are listed below

## Projects

### Martian Munchies

<hr>

A restaurant on Mars which features intergalactic payments using ETH. It uses ERC1155 tokens to give out fungible tokens when you order from the restaurant. They can later be used to avail special offers. It also gives out NFTs for specific limited edition items in the restaurant which you can flaunt on your profile.

This project got us the podium at the hackathon we presented it at.

### Other freelance projects

I also have a few freelance projects which I made for a client. I cannot disclose the full details about them But here is an overview of some of them

1. A telegram bot which allows you to track any wallet activity on popular EVM based chains like ETH mainnet, BSC and Arbitrum. It tracks all currency transactions, ERC20 transfers, and DEX transactions via Uniswap v2 and v3, PancakeSwap and SushiSwap.
2. Multiple frontend interfaces to interact with custom smart contracts.
